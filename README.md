### Link : https://www.kaggle.com/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset

### Context

According to the World Health Organization (WHO) stroke is the 2nd leading cause of death globally, responsible for approximately 11% of total deaths.
This dataset is used to predict whether a patient is likely to get stroke based on the input parameters like gender, age, various diseases, and smoking status. 

### Project Description
This project aims to predict the occurrence of stroke (which, according to WHO, is the 2nd leading cause of death globally and contributing to approximately 11% of total deaths) in a person depending on the patient's pre-medical conditions such as hypertension, heart disease and smoking habits using Decision Trees. 
Performed Exploratory Data Analysis and Stratified K-fold cross-validation.
Used sampling techniques to equalize a severely unbalanced dataset and increased the accuracy of the model by more than 300%
